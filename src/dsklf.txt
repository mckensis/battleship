Create the main game loop and a module for DOM interaction.

At this point it is appropriate to begin crafting your User Interface.

The game loop should set up a new game by creating Players and Gameboards. 
For now just populate each Gameboard with predetermined coordinates.
You can implement a system for allowing players to place their ships later.

We’ll leave the HTML implementation up to you for now,
but you should display both the player’s boards and render them using information from the Gameboard class.

You need methods to render the gameboards and to take user input for attacking. For attacks, let the user click on a coordinate in the enemy Gameboard.

The game loop should step through the game turn by turn using only methods from other objects.
If at any point you are tempted to write a new function inside the game loop, step back and figure out which class or module that function should belong to.

Create conditions so that the game ends once one players ships have all been sunk. This function is appropriate for the Game module.

Finish it up

There are several options available for letting users place their ships.
You can let them type coordinates for each ship, or investigate implementing drag and drop.

You can polish the intelligence of the computer player by having it try adjacent slots after getting a ‘hit’.

Optionally, create a 2 player option that lets users take turns by passing the device back and forth.
If you’re going to go this route, make sure the game is playable on a mobile screen and implement a ‘pass device’ screen,
so that players don’t see each others boards!
